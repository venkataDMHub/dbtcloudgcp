## About 
dbt project that will host  our SQL transformations. 

## Formatting
[sqlfluff](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) formats all the SQL files. There is a 
[VSCode extension](https://github.com/sqlfluff/vscode-sqlfluff) for autoformatting on save. You can
also run `sqlfluff fix <path_to_sql_file>` via the command line. Make sure to run it from the folder with the
`.sqlfluff` config!
